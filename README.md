## Environment
There are two ways to set up your environment:
1. Create Conda Env using yaml file
2. install all required packages via pip

Although both way should work, I strongly recommand you to create conda env via yaml file.

**conda_env.yml** - Conda Environment Export

**requirements.txt** - Pip Packages Export
